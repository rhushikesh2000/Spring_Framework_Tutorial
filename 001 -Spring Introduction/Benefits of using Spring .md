## Spring Framework in Java: advantages 
Using the Spring framework, developers can leverage the below-listed advantages: 

- Pre-defined Templates
  ---
Spring framework contains various types of templates for Hibernate, JDBC, and JPA technologies. With the help of this approach, developers are not required to define complex code. 

Example: JdbcTemplate - Here, we do not need to write the logic for creating a statement, committing the transaction, creating a connection, and exception handling. It saves the time-consuming approach.

- Loose Coupling
  ---
We can consider Spring applications to be loosely coupled as per the dependency injection mechanisms.

- Easy and Simple to Test
  ---
It is easy to test the entire application using a spring framework with a dependency injection mechanism. The EJB or Struts application requires the server to execute the application.

- Non-invasive
  ---
As per the Plain Old Java Object (POJO) technique, Spring is easy to implement as it does not force the developer to inherit certain classes or implementations on any interface.

- Fast Development
  ---
With the help of Dependency Injection, it is easy to integrate the framework and support the development of JavaEE-based applications.

- Strong Abstraction Support
  ---
Spring supports the strong abstraction capability for Java EE-based specifications, such as JMS, JDBC, JPA, and JTA.

- Spring's Web Framework is Well-Organized
  ---
It is a web MVC framework that delivers a fantastic option to web frameworks for developing applications using Struts or different widespread web frameworks.

- Spring Delivers a Suitable API
  ---
It translates technology-specific anomalies thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO into uniform, uncontrolled exceptions.

- Lightweight IoC
  ---
It is lightweight, particularly when compared to EJB containers, for example. This helps create and deploy applications on computers with restricted memory and CPU resources.

- Constant Transaction Management
  ---
Spring provides an interface that can help scale down to a local transaction (for example, using a single database) and scale up to global transactions (for example, JTA).
