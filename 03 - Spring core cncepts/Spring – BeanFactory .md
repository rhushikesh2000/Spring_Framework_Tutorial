#### Spring â€“ BeanFactory

The first and foremost thing when we talk about spring is dependency injection which is possible because spring is actually a container and behaves as a factory of Beans. Just like the  BeanFactory interface is the simplest container providing an advanced configuration mechanism to instantiate, configure, and manage the life cycle of beans. Beans are Java objects that are configured at run-time by Spring IoC Container. BeanFactory represents a basic IoC container which is a parent interface of ApplicationContext. BeanFactory uses Beans and their dependencies metadata to create and configure them at run-time. BeanFactory loads the bean definitions and dependency amongst the beans based on a configuration file(XML) or the beans can be directly returned when required using Java Configuration. There are other types of configuration files like LDAP, RDMS, properties files, etc. BeanFactory does not support Annotation-based configuration whereas ApplicationContext does.
